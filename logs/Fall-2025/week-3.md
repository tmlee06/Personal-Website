Happy Thanksgiving week everyone!

We or at least I am at the final stretch of the year. After my finals, I am clocking out until 2026. Here's what happened this week starting from (11/17/2025):

Another early start, no flight this time, but had to make the [Flixbus][1] from UCLA back to UCSD at 6:20 AM. Luckily, getting to the stop was easy and there were little to no delays. Seeing how one of the world's most populist city moves at dawn was quite an experience, I have never seen LA be so calm, slow, and quiet before because there is always traffic. Without traffic, you get to really admire and take in all the scenery around That LA lifestyle is truly something else, driving past that skyline, seeing the Crypto.com Arena (It will always be Staples Center to me), Hollywood Sign, etc. you just feel it.

Being an honorary bruin for a day was fun, but I do not think I will hit the transfer portal. It's very tempting to submit that UC Application again, but I need to remind myself that if they did not want me then, I should not want them now. You go where you are meant to go, not where you want to go, and I like where I am at right now. La Jolla is beautiful; you can not beat waking up to the most beautiful sunrise, and working on your golf swing with the ocean to your left. I am sure I will find my way to that LA lifestyle in the future.

Food situation has gotten better. I do not believe I will be going back to the dining halls anytime soon. I figured out how to cook rice from the grain and fluffy scrambled eggs with a microwave, and that's been my diet for the past week, along with [Mentaiko][2] pasta. Chef Mic has been feeding me good and efficiently, I no longer have to wait for 30 minutes to get a mass-produced sub 700 calories meal for $18. Food on the dining plan is expensive, but I am killing the dining dollars through the markets on campus. The markets have a very limited supply, I went to H-Mart on Sunday, and I could not be happier to see a grocery store, let alone an Asian one. My colleague told me about the grocery shuttle that runs every weekend, which is a huge win, meaning I do not have to rip the Enterprise Car Share if I want to go on a grocery run, and the shuttle stops at a Costco too, life is good in La Jolla!

Besides the food situation, it was the same spiel for this week of just trying to make it to the end of the quarter. Registration for next quarter came out, and I managed to get all the classes I needed to take, which I am happy about, but scared too. I am scared about not having those classes anymore in the event I fail my courses this quarter. When I was registering, I was thinking to myself like "How can I get through the next course when I can not understand the prerequisite course?" Next quarter seems so far ahead when it is only a month and a bit from now. I just have to take it day by day and try to do my best.

Midterm season is officially over, I had two yesterday. Going into them, I thought I prepared well, but when seeing those questions, it was a whole other story. I did my best, but could be better and that is not enough. That is such a self-depreciating statement, but unfortunately that has been my mental this quarter in terms of academics and hockey. I do not know why I put so much pressure on myself and why my enemy is my inner me. I am conflicted in terms of wanting to prove something to myself and proving something to others. My mind's a storm right now, and I have to figure out how to dance in the rain. I picked up this verse the other day, I thought I would share.

James 1:12:
"Blessed is the one who perseveres under trial because, having stood the test, that person will receive the crown of life that the Lord has promised to those who love him."

Finals are two weeks out and there's nothing more to be said from me, I understand the work and studying that needs to be done. There's no Thanksgiving break since I am not going home, but I am thankful for this opportunity to push through this meaningful suffering. The Lord steers the ship, but I have to row. I am adopting the LeBron mindset: "Instead of saying, 'Why me?' This is what He wants me to do." My 45% fail rate course is on par to 2016 73-9 Golden State, but truth be told, you can apply this mindset to any hardship in your life. You are only a victim if you choose to be. To anyone out there, I encourage you to watch some of the videos I embedded and just keep going.

This is a wrap on the Fall logs and on me for a while, I will be deactivating the Instagram for this stretch. Getting back to the process and grind will make me stronger, I will be back 2026 to give you the summary.

Happy Thanksgiving and Happy Holidays!
