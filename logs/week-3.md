Happy Thanksgiving week everyone!

We or at least I am at the final stretch of the year. After my finals, I am clocking out until 2026. Here's what happened this week starting from (11/17/2025):

Another early start, no flight this time, but had to make the [Flixbus][1] from UCLA back to UCSD at 6:20 AM. Luckily, getting to the stop was easy and there were little to no delays. Seeing how one of the world's most populist city moves at dawn was quite an experience, I have never seen LA be so calm, slow, and quiet before because there is always traffic. Without traffic, you get to really admire and take in all the scenery around That LA lifestyle is truly something else, driving past that skyline, seeing the Crypto.com Arena (It will always be Staples Center to me), Hollywood Sign, etc. you just feel it. (Off topic, but so glad LeBron is back for year 23!)

Being an honorary bruin for a day was fun, but I do not think I will hit the transfer portal. It's very convincing to submit that UC Application again, but I need to remind myself that if they did not want me then, I should not want them now. You go where you are meant to go, not where you want to go, and I like where I am at right now. La Jolla is beautiful; you can not beat waking up to the most beautiful sunrise and shooting at the range with the ocean on your left. I am sure I will find my way to that LA lifestyle in the future.
