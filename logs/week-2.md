Hey everyone!

Making a new format to the logs, so I am not cramming my whole week at the end, which is pretty time consuming.

Sunday (11/09/2025):

Tough, but fun weekend in Seattle and Bellingham!

Team went 0-2, first loss was atrocious and we should have won the second one, but onto the next now. I think I played pretty well for the most part, but did not produce on the stat sheet, so I am still pretty frustrated with myself. I was hoping to finally get the monkey off my back in those games, but I guess I will have to wait. I know it's not a matter of "if" it will happen, but more of a matter of "when" it will happen. I know once I break, I will break. At this point it is all mental and I just need to figure myself out and get my game back.

Other than hockey, I had a great experience eating at Pike's Public Market, walking around downtown Seattle, visiting University of Washington, and looking at Mount Rainier. Washington and the Pacific Northwest in general have such great natural beauty, but does not compare to California (I say this without ever visiting a National Park in the 14 years I lived there). Maybe in my 20s I can start filling up my National Parks Passport. Probably going to get some flack for this take, but Seattle is the West Coast's Boston. I must say UDub got a beautiful campus and library, I am very happy for my friends who get to go there and very jealous that they have a good college football team there, but not jealous of the weather, they can keep the rain.

Brutal.
